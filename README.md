DESCRIPTION

File Integrity Checker
This Python script provides a comprehensive file integrity checking solution by monitoring file changes through cryptographic hashing and metadata comparison.

Core Functionality

Hashing Algorithms
-Supports multiple hash algorithms (SHA-256 by default)
,efficient hash calculation with progress reporting
,Parallel processing for improved performance

Baseline Management
-Creates compressed snapshots of file states
,Stores file hashes with metadata (size, timestamps, permissions)
,Version-controlled baseline format
,Atomic write operations for data safety

Integrity Verification
-Compares current file states against baseline
,Detects:
 -Content changes (via hash comparison)
 ,Metadata modifications (size, timestamps)
 ,Permission changes
 ,New/deleted files
